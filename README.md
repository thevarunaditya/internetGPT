# internetGPT
internetGPT (by monohuman) is a python-run nodejs terminal with the sole purpose of giving GPT models access to certain search results that are generated by a human. I learned the basics of my code from VRSEN's youtube video. [You can find his github repo here](https://github.com/VRSEN/chatgtp-bing-clone). I added discord webhook support for history, so if you want me to add it, leave a comment/issue/pull request (i don't understahd how comments work yet). The functionality of internet GPT is built to be usable at a small scale or a large scale, so it appeals to people of all uses.
# Installation
The steps are moderately easy. You might need a bit of coding experience, but it should be quite straightforward with my youtube video.

`1.` Click the green **<> Code** button, and click **Download ZIP**. Then unzip the zip that downloads, and you will be left with a folder named **internetGPT-main** (or something like that).

`2.` **To make the following steps easier, watch my YouTube video linked at the tippity top of this text.** Open script.py, and (1) replace "apikey" in line 4 with your openai api key. (2) Then, also go to the link commented in line 9 and get customsearch credentials. (3) Finally, go to the link commented in line 17, and get a search engine id.

`3.` Open terminal, and enter the following lines (1 line at a time):
```
cd (drag the folder to this line, or type to file path to the folder)
npm install package.json
node server.js
```

`4.` Open your browser, and go to the link it tells you to go to. There you go, its easy as that!
